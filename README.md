# to-do list

A web application that allows you to create a to do list by adding each task. The list is saved to your local storage and when the website is reopened your previous list is automatically opened. It saves your data after every action to make sure the list is up to date.

This is a project created using this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0jO8kUrg-I&list=PLjwm_8O3suyOgDS_Z8AWbbq3zpCmR-WE9&index=2

## Skills Learned

- Using Javascript to interact with an HTML frontend
- Saving data and retrieving it from local storage

## Reflection

It's a simple program but introduces me to Javascript in a way that I can understand the syntax and apply to a real-life web app.

## Looking Ahead

- I can add a backup function in case someone deletes all their tasks or the data stored in their local storage by accident
- I can include an online backup system where the data is uploaded to an encrypted cloud server
- I can include an edit function to change tasks
- I can add a calendar system and add the ability to give deadlines for each task
- I can add reminders to send the user to remind them of their tasks
